- "+" increases branch turn speed
- "-" decreases branch turn speed
- "*" increases branch length and decreases other branch length
- "/" decreases branch length and increases other branch length
- ")" increases max number of iterations
- "(" decreases max number of iterations
- "x" increases the increase of iterations per frame in slow draw
- "y" decreases the increase of iterations per frame in slow draw
- "(0-9)" saves the current configuration into the save buffer (overrides the buffer if buffer not empty)
- "." loads the save of the next inputted number
- "(-)" the negate sign (left of enter) undoes the last load (when loading into a buffer, pressing negate basically undoes that action)
